## Overview of Election Audit 

The audit aims to develop the election data further and determine additional details. The results were consistent with the solution; however, the “print” output was not similar to the solution. 

## Election-Audit Results: 
1.	What is the total count? 369,711 votes
2.	Vote breakdown by County:
  a.	Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  b.	Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  c.	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
3.	Denver county had the majority of the votes
4.	Vote Breakdown by Candidate:
  a.	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  b.	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  c.	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
5.	Diana DeGette collected 73.8% of the total votes, thereby winning the election with a total vote count of 272,892.

## Election-Audit Summary: 
The application of the programming script can work across several elections. First, depending on uploading the CSV file and ensuring the variables represent the state, localities, and candidates. 

### Final thought: 
This was a challenging task- I took several days to debug this and go back over the module.  Although painful it served me well to continue to rework it
